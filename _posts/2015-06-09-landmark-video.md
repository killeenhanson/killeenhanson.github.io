description: "This short film was made at Pacific Northwest College of Art while I worked there as Director of Strategic Partnerships. The short film was screened at the 2015 Annual Gala.
<br><br>
I wrote the film's script, collected the archival materials, and collaborated on its production with Janique L. Robillard (Director & Producer) and Paulius Kontijevas (Director of Photography). Paulius Kontijevas did the color correction and sound design, Caitlin Wilbert edited the film and motion graphics, Logan Anderson was the production assistant, Kat Harrington's voice provided the narration and Josh Millman at Talkback Sound did the voiceover recording."
