description: "A quartet of bound transcripts and trio of chairs. Bookboard, paper, ink, white oak, 2012.<br /><br />

I began this project wondering whether it was possible to write a portrait of a place via portraits of its residents. That original question morphed over the course of a year into a more appropriately intimate wondering: What is radical listening and how can we practice it for and with each other?<br /><br />

The result was a tentative definition and ethos of practice that took final shape as three bound and extravagently annotated transcripts, an index volume compiling and collating the transcripts' collective marginalia, and a trio of chairs that both represent the physical bodies between whom the defining conversations took place, and invite the public into those conversations.<br /><br />

The project began in three one-on-one conversations between strangers and was cared for through the academic practices of research, annotation, and citation. The books return the project to the human scale.<br /><br />

Unexpectedly, my interest in listening to others took me away from in-person interactions and into the quietude of the library. The resulting marginalia (anecdotal accounts, lists, statistics, historical research, etc), however, are not intellectually impartial: they reflect my personal history, interests, and curiosities. Thus, the resulting index is both a self-portrait and a portrait of the persons with whom I spoke. But these two types of portraits, I experienced a profound kind of fraternity.<br /><br />

The world does not need more evidence of disconnect."
