title: Questions Lead to Questions
tags: Research
description: A wall-sized mind map that investigated three central questions of documentary-based art. Is the work in the preparation for the exchange? In the exchange itself? Or in the document of the exchange? Each question led to further questions and evidence in the form of text, image, and sound.<br><br>This was preparatory work for my graduate practicum in Applied Craft and Design.
