description: "In 2014, artist Abigail Anne Newbold led the <i>Academy for Survival</i>, an artist residency and backcountry instructional retreat that tested the skills required to live self-sufficiently and examined issues of portability, survival, and independence. During the residency, I played the role of documentarian: filming the participant artists as they tramped around the wooded property and interviewing the visiting artists and instructors.
<br><br>
The <i>Academy for Survival</i> residency was offered alongside <i>Abigail Anne Newbold: Borderlander's Outfitter</i>, an exhibition curated by Sarah Margolis-Pineo at Museum of Contemporary Craft and in collaboration with the Philip Feldman Gallery + Project Space, the MFA in Applied Craft + Design, a joint MFA from Oregon College of Art and Craft and Pacific Northwest College of Art, and Leland Iron Works artist residency program. This timelapse video was included in the exhibition installtion."
