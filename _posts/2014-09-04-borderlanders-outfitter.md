title: Academy For Survival
tags: Video
description: "Part collector, part craftsman, part designer, Abigail Anne Newbold utilizes a domestic vocabulary to create objects and installations that examine issues of portability, survival, and independence. In 2014, Newbold led the <i>Academy for Survival</i>, an artist residency and backcountry instructional retreat that tested the skills required to live self-sufficiently by combining the traditional craft and modern material. I played the role of documentarian: interviewing the visiting artists and survivalist instructors and filming the participant artists as they tramped around the wooded property.
<br><br>
The <i>Academy for Survival</i> was presented in as part of <i>Abigail Anne Newbold: Borderlander's Outfitter</i>, an exhibition curated by Sarah Margolis-Pineo at Museum of Contemporary Craft and in collaboration with the Philip Feldman Gallery + Project Space, the MFA in Applied Craft + Design, a joint MFA from Oregon College of Art and Craft and Pacific Northwest College of Art, and Leland Iron Works artist residency program."
