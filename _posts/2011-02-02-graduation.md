<p>"<i>In the end, <br/>
I think that I will like that we were sitting on the bed, <br/>
talking <br/>
and wondering <br/>
    where the time had gone.</i> <br/>
<br/>
Twice-steeped tea, <br/>
hands ‘round a red ceramic mug. <br/>
Pet rocks sitting on the window <br/>
sill. I think of you <br/>
that afternoon <br/>
laughing <br/>
and somber. <br/>
<br/>
Two girls <br/>
not long gone from school. <br/>
You were the blond, <br/>
I wore the glasses <br/>
and we hadn’t the slightest idea <br/>
what the hell we were doing. <br/>
<br/>
When I write you letters now, <br/>
postmarked Sitka, Alaska, <br/>
I think back to that afternoon. <br/>
We sat there, <br/>
planning out our lives. <br/>
Jobs, boyfriends, <br/>
trumpet solos. <br/>
<br/>
It was terrifying, <br/>
that wide wide world. <br/>
But sweet, <br/>
so sweet. <br/>

From Brian Andreas." </p>
