<div class="images-right"><p>&uarr; For two years, I taught documentary filmmaking with <i>Recording Resilience</i>, a program at <a href="https://nwdocumentary.org/youth-programs/">NW Documentary</a> in Portland, Oregon for teens who have recently suffered the tragic loss of a loved one. In partnership with the Dougy Center, we offer a supportive, healing opportunity for the participants to create a personal documentary about their loss. Participants then share their film at a public screening and within larger support groups at <a href="https://www.dougy.org/">The Dougy Center</a></p></div>
