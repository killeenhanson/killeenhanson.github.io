title: What We Talk About When We Talk About Graphic Design
tags: Curation
discription: Based on my podcast, <a href="http://www.scratchingthesurface.fm">Scratching the Surface</a>, What We Talk About When We Talk About Graphic Design is a small exhibition I curated of work from the guests of the first set of interviews I conducted. The work showcased — from designers like Armin Vit, Experimental Jetset, Dexter Sinister, and the Google Design team — is a collection critical design that seeks to further and deepen the graphic design discourse.
