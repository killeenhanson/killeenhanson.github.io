title: Scratching the Surface
tags: Podcast
discription: Scratching the Surface is a weekly design podcast about the intersection of criticism and practice. Each week, I interview designers, writers, critics, educators and those that operate between these fields about how writing, criticism, and theory informs individual practice and the graphic design profession at large. Previous guests have included Michael Rock, Michael Bierut, Alexandra Lange, Jessica Helfand, Steven Heller, and others.
