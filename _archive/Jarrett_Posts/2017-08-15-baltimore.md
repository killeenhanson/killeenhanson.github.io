discription: I lived in Baltimore for two years while in graduate school and took thousands of photos around the city during my free time. I collected my favorite images taken over those two years and published them in a small book. I spent a lot of time honing my photographic voice, inspired by street photographers like Stephen Shore, Hilla Brechter, and Saul Leiter, mostly capturing empty streetscapes devoid of people.
