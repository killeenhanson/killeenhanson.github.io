title: Dharma Initiative Annual Report
tags: Design
discription: I had always wanted to do a something to honor ABC hit television show LOST. One part of the show that always fascinated me was the DHARMA Initiative, a fictitious organization steeped in mystery. I thought it'd be interesting to take the mystery surrounding DHARMA and create an annual report for the company.
