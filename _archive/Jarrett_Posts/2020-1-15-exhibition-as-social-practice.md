title: "Exhibition Design as Social Practice"
tags: Event
discription: "Sponsored by AIA New York and organized by Isometric Studio, Exhibition Design as Social Practice featured presentations from Abbott Miller of Pentagram, Alicia Cheng and Sarah Gephart of MGMT, Jonathan JAckson of We Should Do It All, and Andy Chen and Waqas Jawaid of Isometric Studio. I had the honor of hosting and moderating a panel discussion after the presentations. Panelists discussed exhibition design as a practice that makes previously underrepresented narratives tangible in public spaces, inspiring new cultural conversations and creating alignments among architecture, graphic design, and social movements."
