discription: After an eight month haitus, <a href="http://www.rorykingdesign.com">Rory King</A> and I decided to relaunch <a href="http://www.jarrettfuller.com/portfolio/design/swayzine.htm">Sway</a> in all new format. Instead of a magazine, the new format was an on-going experiment in research, curation, art direction, and dialogue centered on weekly themes.
categories:
- Curation
- Art Direction

<p>&uarr; "The plan is that the plan is wide open. Sway can and will be whatever Rory and I want it to be week to week. It’s about working in public. It’s about design as a platform for curatorial, editorial, and publishing experiments." —<a href="http://jarrettfuller.tumblr.com/post/52763017764/the-new-sway">from my relaunch statement</A></p></div>

<div class="images-right"><p>&uarr; In between the curatorial weeks, Rory and I will occasionally engage in self-initiated design challenges. For the week leading up to the launch, we designed a poster each day until the full reveal.</p></div>
