discription: Study Hall is hybrid online community and newsletter for freelancers and media and a creative studio specializing in editorial and brand strategy founded by Kyle Chayka and Peter Moskowitz. They needed two sites â€”  one to relaunch the community and another to showcase their studio's work. I designed both sites that could be seen together but also act as stand alone sites. You can visit the sites at <a href="http://www.studyhall.xyz">studyhall.xyz</a> and <a href="http://www.studyhall.studio">studyhall.studio</a>.

<div class="images-right"><p>&uarr; The community site's primary goal is to get people to sign up for the newsletter and join their Patreon community. The site is a single, long-scroll page that highlights what they offer while also advertising their co-working space and even series.</p></div>

<div class="images-right"><p>&uarr; The studio site uses the same colors as Community, but keeps the design simple to highlight the studio's work.</p></div>
