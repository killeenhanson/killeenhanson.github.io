tags: Design
discription: As part of Parsons School of Design's annual graduation exhibition, I designed a three-panel window display to showcase the school's communication design department. Displayed right off Fifth Avenue in New York, we wanted to make the department's work available to the public, while also allowing every student to be represented.
