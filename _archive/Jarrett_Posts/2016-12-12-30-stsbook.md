tags: Design
discription: The Scratching the Surface book is a printed companion to my podcast of the same name. This book commenorates the first season of interviews by including an essay penned by each of my guests as well as an essay written by a critic who has inspired or influenced them. The entire book is set in Helvetica and Times New Roman, at once reinforcing and subverting a default aesthetic.
