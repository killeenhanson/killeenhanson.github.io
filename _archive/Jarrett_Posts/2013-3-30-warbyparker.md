discription: For two years between 2011-2013, I was a designer at Warby Parker, an online eyewear startup in New York City. As a part of the small team, I helped work on all aspects of the company's design, focusing primarily on the e-commerce site, but also special marketing pages, print collateral, and select brand pieces.
