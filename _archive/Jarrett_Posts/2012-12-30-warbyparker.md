discription: For the second year in a row, Warby Parker wanted to created an interactive year in review to tell the story of the past year. As a part of the creative team, we designed and built a scrolling wheel that spun in your browser to share interesting facts, company milestones, collection launches, and other fun secrets.The report was featured in <a href="http://www.adweek.com/adfreak/warby-parkers-latest-annual-report-infographic-sight-sore-eyes-146593">AdWeek</A>, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/patrickhanlon/2013/01/16/warby-parker-eyewear-launches-annual-report-transparency/">Forbes</A>, <a href="http://yewknee.com/blog/the-2012-warby-parker-annual-report/">Yewknee</A> and more.
