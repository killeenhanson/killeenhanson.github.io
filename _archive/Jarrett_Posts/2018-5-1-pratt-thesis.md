title: Pratt Institute Communications Design Thesis Website
tags: Design
discription: Every year, Pratt Institute's Graduate Communication Design program publishes a printed publication to showcase the graduating students' work. In 2018, I worked with the department (where I'm also faculty) to design a digital publication in place of the traditional printed book. We created a searchible database that houses detailed descriptions and images of every student's final thesis project.
