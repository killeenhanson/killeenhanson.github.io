title: Facebook GMS Summit 2015 Branding
tags: Design
discription: The Facebook Global Marketing Solutions Summit is an annual internal sales conference held in San Francisco, CA. In 2015, I designed and developed the conference's identity based on the theme "Redefine." Continuing the 'evolving identity' approach I worked on the previous year, I developed a system where the word "redefine" would be written in conference attendees handwriting. We worked with an external agency to push the brand into stage design, signage, and environmental graphics

<div class="images-right"><P>&uarr; The conference's theme this year was "Redefine", so we had attendees write the word in their own handwriting and used those as various marks around the conference. This visualized the key themes in redefine like editing, personality, and process that we then paired with famous figures who have redefined industries in history.</p></div>
