title: Facebook GMS Summit 2014 Branding
tags: Design
discription: The Facebook Global Marketing Solutions Summit is an annual internal sales conference held in San Francisco, CA. In 2014, I designed and developed the conference's identity based on the theme "Dare." Instead of a traditional static logo like the conference had done in the past, I developed an ever-changing system where the letters in DARE revealed different imagery of daring or adventurous activities. In addition to the branding, I also worked on all the environmental design, signage, and stage design.
