title: "Self-Reliance: Thoughts for a New World"
tags: Design
discription: "At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, writer (and frequent collaborator) Jessica Helfand began writing daily essays on studio practice, making, and art based on Ralph Waldo Emerson's classic essay on self-reliance. Thames and Hudson, under their experimental imprint Volume, has packaged those essays, along with the full text from Emerson's essay in a compact book. I worked closely with Jessica on the design and concept."
