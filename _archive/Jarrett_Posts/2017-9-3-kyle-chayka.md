discription: Kyle Chayka is a freelance writer based in Brooklyn who's contributed to publications including <i>The New York Times Magazine</i>, <i>New Republic</i>, <i>Businessweek</i>, <i>n+1</i>, and many others. Kyle needed a personal site to centralize his writing, house his archive of past work, and share news on his upcoming book. I designed and built a site that includes a massive filter-based archive while also allowing Kyle to update new work and other relevant news.
