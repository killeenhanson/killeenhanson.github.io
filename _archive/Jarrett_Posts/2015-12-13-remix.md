title: Remixed Portfolio
tags: Design
discription: This is an exploration into what makes a designer; a desconstruction of old work, repurposed in a new context. As I took apart the school projects, the posters for friendsâ€™ bands, the sketches I never showed anyone, I began to see patterns. The familiar tropes I used as I was learning graphic design started to emerge. By deconstructing the fundamental projects in my education, I saw a version of myself reflected back to me, and saw these projects in new ways. This is a book of discarded parts, a deconstructed portfolio, a monograph of remixed fragments.
