title: New York, Summer 2016
tags: Photography
discription: Published in 2016, <i>New York, Summer 2016</i>, is a collection of my photographs from living in New York City during the summer of 2016. Inspired by photographers like Hilla Brechter, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Saul Leiter, and Teju Cole, my photographic work moved into a street photography space interested in texture, landscape, and minimalism. Devoid of humans, the images offer a quiet, alternative view of the city. To collect the images, I designed this book, pairing images together that sometimes reinforce and sometimes subvert the relationships and themes I return to again and again in my photography. The book will be available for sale soon.
