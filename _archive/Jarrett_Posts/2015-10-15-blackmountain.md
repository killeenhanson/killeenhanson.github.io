title: Black Mountain College — A Survey
tags: Design
discription: <i>Black Mountain College — A Survey</i> is a book I edited and designed on the experimental art college in North Carolina in the 1930s-50s. I selected various essays and each one focuses on a particular medium, teacher, or student, each building upon the one that came before. In between each essay are image galleries with images I've curated from the different artists from the college including Josef Albers, Rose Asawa, and John Cage. The design of the book follows a strict grid system that allows for various layouts across each spread while retaining a structure that is followed as the book progresses.
