description: This project-based course introduces information theory and the various means of visually representing the world with the intention of uncovering hidden realities and effects. Throughout the course, students explore, analyse and reconfigure quantitative and qualitative data and use fundamental graphical principles to present their findings. Students hence engage with mapping as a creative activity that sets the stage for the planning of design interventions.
